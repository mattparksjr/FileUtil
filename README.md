# FileUtil
FileUtil is a project designed to solve some challenge problems.    
I wanted to find something to code while improving my skills, While doing so
I ran across this: https://www.w3resource.com/java-exercises/io/index.php    
From there I decided to try and solve the challenges. 

# Program design
This gets the job done by adding an interface called ```ICommand```. Each
command implements this interface. Once the program recognises the command, 
it calls the implementing class to execute the command!
