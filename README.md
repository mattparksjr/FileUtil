# FileUtil
FileUtil is a small project by well me, Matthew.
I wanted to find something to code while improving my skills and came up with this.
It has a few utility commands for working with files.
The challages were grabbed from here: https://www.w3resource.com/java-exercises/io/index.php#editorr.

This was just fun and ill try to improve it and add comments but yeah. Its just pratice. 

Pull request are welcome if anyone aucally reads this...
